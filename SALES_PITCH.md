## The Problem This Solves

### Current Automation is Broken

**Traditional RPA/Workflow Tools:**
- Break when anything changes
- Can't handle exceptions or edge cases
- Require months of developer time for every workflow
- Linear thinking only—no complex reasoning
- High maintenance costs (85% of budget goes to upkeep)
- Fail and stop—no error recovery
- Cost $12K-$50K per workflow to implement

**AI-Assisted Tools (Current Generation):**
- Still require humans to make all decisions
- AI is just a helper, not autonomous
- Can't chain multiple steps together
- No learning or adaptation
- Limited to simple classification tasks

### The Real Cost

Enterprises spend **$2.1 trillion annually** on manual processes that could be automated. But traditional automation only captures 15-20% of that opportunity because it can't handle:
- Multi-step reasoning
- Unexpected scenarios
- Complex decision trees
- Cross-system integration
- Human oversight requirements
- Continuous learning

---
